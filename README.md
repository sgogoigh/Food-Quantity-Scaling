# Food Ingredient Scaling


This report presents a comprehensive evaluation of four different approaches for scaling ingredient quantities in paneer-based recipes. The evaluation uses data from four traditional Indian paneer dishes across four serving sizes (1-4 people) to determine the most accurate scaling method.

**Key Finding**: The **Weighted Proportional Scaling** method demonstrates superior performance across multiple evaluation metrics, providing the most accurate ingredient quantity predictions.

## 1. Problem Statement

Given ingredient quantities for any two serving sizes of a paneer recipe, predict the ingredient quantities for other serving sizes. The challenge lies in developing robust scaling methods that can:

- Work with any pair of reference serving sizes
- Generalize across different recipes and ingredients
- Provide accurate predictions for both interpolation and extrapolation scenarios
- Handle the non-linear scaling behavior inherent in cooking recipes

## 2. Dataset Overview

The evaluation uses a comprehensive dataset containing four popular paneer recipes:

1. **Palak Paneer** - 10 ingredients per serving size
2. **Shahi Paneer** - 8 ingredients per serving size  
3. **Matar Paneer** - 10 ingredients per serving size
4. **Paneer Masala** - 5 ingredients per serving size

Each recipe includes precise ingredient quantities for serving sizes 1, 2, 3, and 4 people, totaling 132 individual ingredient-serving combinations.

### Data Preprocessing

Ingredient quantities are extracted from complex string formats (e.g., "1¼ nos. / 80 grams") using regex pattern matching and fraction conversion, handling special Unicode characters commonly found in recipe data.

## 3. Scaling Methods Evaluated

### 3.1 Linear Interpolation/Extrapolation

**Mathematical Foundation**:
```
y = mx + b
where m = (qty2 - qty1) / (size2 - size1)
      b = qty1 - m × size1
```

**Approach**: Assumes a perfectly linear relationship between serving size and ingredient quantity. Uses two reference points to establish a linear equation and predicts quantities for target serving sizes.

**Advantages**:
- Simple and intuitive
- Mathematically exact for truly linear relationships
- Handles both interpolation and extrapolation naturally

**Limitations**:
- Assumes strict linearity, which may not hold for all ingredients
- Sensitive to measurement errors in reference points

### 3.2 Proportional Scaling

**Mathematical Foundation**:
```
average_factor = (qty1/size1 + qty2/size2) / 2
predicted_qty = average_factor × target_size
```

**Approach**: Calculates scaling factors from both reference points and uses their arithmetic mean to predict target quantities.

**Advantages**:
- Robust to individual measurement errors
- Simple conceptual model
- Natural handling of proportional relationships

**Limitations**:
- Equal weighting may not be optimal for all scenarios
- Can be influenced by outlier scaling factors

### 3.3 Weighted Proportional Scaling

**Mathematical Foundation**:
```
weight1 = 1 / |target_size - size1|
weight2 = 1 / |target_size - size2|
weighted_factor = (weight1 × factor1 + weight2 × factor2) / (weight1 + weight2)
```

**Approach**: Assigns higher weights to reference points closer to the target serving size, using inverse distance weighting.

**Advantages**:
- Adapts to the specific prediction scenario
- More accurate for interpolation scenarios
- Reduces impact of distant reference points

**Limitations**:
- More complex calculation
- Requires careful handling of zero-distance cases

### 3.4 Geometric Mean Scaling

**Mathematical Foundation**:
```
geometric_factor = √(factor1 × factor2)
predicted_qty = geometric_factor × target_size
```

**Approach**: Uses the geometric mean of scaling factors, which can be more appropriate for multiplicative processes.

**Advantages**:
- Less sensitive to extreme scaling factors
- Theoretically appropriate for multiplicative relationships
- Naturally handles proportional growth patterns

**Limitations**:
- Undefined for negative or zero quantities
- Less intuitive than arithmetic methods

## 4. Evaluation Methodology

### 4.1 Cross-Validation Approach

For each recipe, the evaluation follows this systematic process:

1. **Reference Selection**: Choose all possible pairs from serving sizes {1, 2, 3, 4}
2. **Target Prediction**: Use each pair to predict remaining serving sizes
3. **Method Application**: Apply all four scaling methods to each scenario
4. **Performance Measurement**: Compare predictions against actual values

This results in 6 reference pairs × 2 target predictions × 4 methods × 4 recipes = **192 total evaluation scenarios**.

### 4.2 Evaluation Metrics

#### Primary Metrics

**Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**:
```
MAE = (1/n) × Σ|actual_i - predicted_i|
```
- Measures average prediction error in original units
- Robust to outliers
- Directly interpretable

**Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)**:
```
RMSE = √[(1/n) × Σ(actual_i - predicted_i)²]
```
- Penalizes larger errors more heavily
- Sensitive to outliers
- Standard regression metric

**Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)**:
```
MAPE = (100/n) × Σ|actual_i - predicted_i|/actual_i
```
- Scale-independent comparison
- Intuitive percentage interpretation
- Handles different ingredient magnitudes

#### Secondary Metrics

**Coefficient of Determination (R²)**:
- Measures proportion of variance explained
- Higher values indicate better fit
- Range: -∞ to 1

**Maximum Absolute Error**:
- Identifies worst-case prediction errors
- Important for practical applications
- Robustness indicator

### 4.3 Statistical Significance

The evaluation includes confidence intervals and standard deviations to assess method reliability and statistical significance of performance differences.

    dist2 = abs(target_serving_size - serving_size_2)
    
    # Handle edge cases
    if dist1 == 0:
